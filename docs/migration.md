# IDS Migration: Crosswalk Format and Script Reference

The `idsmigration` script converts tabular experimental data (CSV) into IMAS IDS objects written to HDF5.  It is driven entirely by a spreadsheet called the **crosswalk** (e.g. `resources/mappings/tc26_crosswalk.xlsx`). Everything below describes how to read existing crosswalks and create new ones.

## Crosswalk columns

| Column               | Type                 | Purpose |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| `csv_column`         | str                  | Column/variable name in the source CSV |
| `csv_unit`           | str                  | Unit of the source value |
| `imas_unit`          | str                  | Unit of the IDS target field (automatically populated by DD) |
| `csv_dtype`          | str                  | Storage bucket for `status=manifest` rows (see [Temporary IDSs](#temporary-idss)) |
| `imas_dtype`         | str                  | IDS data type (automatically populated by DD) |
| `imas_path`          | str                  | Target path inside the IDS (see [Path notation](#path-notation-and-indexing)) |
| `csv_description`    | str                  | Description of the source variable from the original database. |
| `imas_description`   | str                  | Description of the IDS target field (automatically populated by DD) |
| `kind`               | str                  | `constant`, `dynamic`, or `static` (automatically populated by DD) |
| `status`             | str                  | `mapped`, `mapped_caveat`, `manifest`, `derived` or `discard` (see [Status values](#status-values)) |
| `notes`              | str                  | Free-text notes, caveats, warnings, etc. |
| `transform`          | str                  | `identity`, `dictionary`, or `formula` (see [Transform types](#transform-types)) |
| `transform_args`     | str                  | Arguments for the transform (dict literal or Python expression). |
| `source_fields`      | str                  | Optional `("value_leaf", "source_leaf")` 2-tuple naming the sibling leaves to write, overriding the pair derived from the DD; defaults to `("value", "source")` (see [Sibling-pair writes](#sibling-pair-writes)) |
| `source`             | str, number, or dict | Value written to the companion sibling leaf. A **string** or **number** is written into every pulse IDS. A **dict** is a `{machine: descriptor}` literal looked up per-pulse via the value mapped to `summary/machine` (see [Sibling-pair writes](#sibling-pair-writes)) |

The spreadsheet describes the **mapping** (what to write and where).  Further concerns describe the **data** instead, and live in a YAML sidecar rather than in a column: no-data placeholders, per-machine error bars, conflict-resolution rules and IMAS standard names (all per-variable), plus a single whole-database description (source, citation, credits).  See [The sidecar](#the-sidecar).

## Getting started

First, you need to install the project in editable mode. From the IDStools directory:

`pip install -e .`

The idsmigration script has an additional dependency on openpyxl and SimDB (optional):

`pip install openpyxl imas-simdb`

To run idsmigration, you need a data .csv file, and a crosswalk .xlsx file. There are four pre-made crosswalks in this directory under `resources/mappings`. The data .csv must be acquired yourself, as it cannot be made publically available in this repository. 

For example, the TC-26 data is available as a supplement to `DOI: 10.1088/1741-4326/ae39f2` at `iopscience.iop.org`. The H-mode confinement data is hosted by OSF at `https://osf.io/drwcq/overview`. 

Once you have this, you can run the migration script. As an example:

`idsmigration -e tc26 -d {TC26_DATA}.csv -m TC26_crosswalk.xlsx --simdb`

`-e tc26` selects the experiment directory relative to `resources/output` where IDS HDF5 files are written for each pulse, if running without --simdb.

`-d {TC26_DATA}.csv` points to the location of the data .csv relative to `resources/input`. 

`-m TC26_crosswalk.xlsx` selects the mapping file in `resources/mappings`.

`--simdb` is an optional flag which additionally ingests each pulse into a local SimDB. The HDF5 files are still written: SimDB references them, and the notebooks read their values from them.

## Authoring the crosswalk

ITPA databases often contain hundreds of variables/csv columns. Writing a crosswalk file that specifies the mapping consists roughly of the following inter-related steps:

1. **BLANK CROSSWALK**: Using `generate_crosswalk` (located in `idstools/scripts`) to create a blank spreadsheet with the proper columns and formulas:

  `python generate_crosswalk [--output path/to/out.xlsx] [--num-rows 200]`

2. **LEGACY PROVENANCE**: Transferring variable definitions from a (usually) .pdf file into the `csv_column`, `csv_description`, and `csv_unit` crosswalk columns.

3. **DATASET PROFILING**: Running `dataset_statistics` (located in `idstools/scripts`) on the obtained data .csv to generate a markdown "profile", to get a human-readable (and LLM-readable) description of the  raw data, to inform the subsequent steps.

4. **IMAS SEARCH**: Searching the IMAS Data Dictionary for candidate paths, placing these in `imas_path`, and effectively comparing the original database definitions (`csv_description`) to the IDS node descriptions (`imas_description`, automatically populated). 

5. **DATA TRANSFORMATIONS**: Related to the previous step, one has to decide the appropriate transformation (`transform`, `transform_args`, potentially `source` and `source_fields` columns) for the chosen `imas_path`.

6. **DESIGNATING STATUS**: In tandem with the previous steps, once paths, transformations and arguments are decided, the `status` column should be designated. Any relevant information for the crosswalk "author(s)" involved in the whole decision process here should be recorded in the free-text `notes` column. `status` is conditional on the caveats of the mapping, particularly 
  - (Near-)exact match of source and target variable definitions, possibly with a transformation (`mapped`).
  - Inexact match of source and target variable definitions, which are not resolved by a transformation or processing step (mostly `mapped_caveat`)
  - CSV columns where a definition is not available, or where data issues are not resolvable by a transformation, which require further investigation, or which cannot be resolved due to lost provenance (also `mapped_caveat`, or `manifest`).
  - Absence of an appropriate imas_path; either `manifest` for quantities that must be kept, `derived` for quantities derivable from mapped variables, or `discard` for variables decided to be excluded from the migrated database. 

7. **SIDECAR YAML**: In addition to the spreadsheet crosswalk, there is the .yaml sidecar. The YAML file is intended to record *data fields* relevant to the mapping, namely *sentinel values* (`sentinels:`), per-variable errors (`errors:`) and also database provenance information (`database:`). These fields are populated conditional on the data issues uncovered by `dataset_statistics` for sentinel values, and errors, which are sometimes available in the variable definition sheet.

More detailed documentation for how the script treats these fields/attributes, rather than prescriptive information for how they should be filled, appears in the remainder of this file.

### Use of LLMs in authoring the crosswalk

The instructions detailed in the previous section are agnostic to whether the crosswalk author is human, an LLM, or most appropriately, a combination of both. Due to the remarkable pace at which these models are evolving, we cannot provide a final prescription for how an agentic or collaborative workflow should operate -- different models across and within generations and service providers show different capabilities and weaknesses. 

The following points are merely suggestions, based on the experience of developing this migration pipeline, and writing the crosswalks for the ITPA databases using varying degrees of automation, from fully manual writing, through partial use of LLMs, to and end-to-end use with minimal prompting; although never without a final review step that results in significant modifications to the output. Your mileage may vary.

  - **TOOLS**: The ***IMAS-DD MCP*** is an invaluable tool for this process. The public endpoint *https://imas-dd.iter.org/mcp* should be configured in your harness. The MCP allows queries of data-dictionary documentation for `imas_path`, and is crucial especially for the initial search based off of csv_description.


  - **CONTEXT**: For context, we find it is best to provide access to as many ***previously authored crosswalk*** .xlsx and .yaml files as possible, in particular, the 4 pre-made crosswalks under `resources/mappings`. It is best to provide the ***relevant research paper*** associated with the database, (i.e. one or more papers that details the experimental and theoretical motivation, and conducts analysis on the database), since physical insight is the original intent for the curation, and the criterion for the inclusion/exclusion of information, of/from these databases. In addition, one should include the ***variable definition sheet*** for filling in the csv_* fields, and the ***raw data CSV*** in the context to conduct detailed investigations of anomalous values, and to inform the mapping process for a given variable. ***This document*** (`migration.md`) and access to the *idsmigration* python script are also crucial.

  - **PROMPT**: The prompt should be as detailed as possible, and should explicitly include automated *validation*, and automated/manual *review* steps at logical boundaries of the workflow. We suggest that you create your own crosswalk authoring **markdown** document in collaboration with an LLM which has the appropriate context (see previous point), which will act as a detailed, enumerated set of instructions. You should also ask the LLM to "interview you" after it performs a detailed search/ingestion of context to *resolve ambiguities* in your initial instruction and to *document your preferences*, especially pertaining to the `status` column, including general preferences for how marginal quantities, transformations, missing paths, etc. should be treated, as detailed in point (**6.**) of the **Authoring a crosswalk** section.

  - **MODEL**: Certain steps in the process are subject to more or less error from an LLM. For example, the transfer of variable definitions, units etc. into the blank crosswalk can be entrusted to a cheaper model and/or with lower effort. However, for generating the prompt/plan markdown file suggested in the previous point, according to the general advice, we suggest the use of the most up-to-date model at high effort. In general, this will depend on your existing setup, and model choice for each section can be included in the process of writing the plan in collaboration with the (ideally) frontier model.

### Missing values and no-data markers

A source value that does not match its target leaf's dtype (a string NA marker like `-`, `.` or `????`, an empty cell, any non-number bound for a numeric leaf) is dropped, leaving the leaf at its IMAS empty (`EMPTY_FLOAT`/`EMPTY_INT`). 

## Transform types

### `identity`

Copies the CSV value directly to the IDS path.  No `transform_args` needed.

```
csv_column: IP
imas_path:  summary/global_quantities/ip
transform:  identity
```

### `dictionary`

Maps discrete CSV values to IDS values via a Python dict in `transform_args`. The string is parsed with `ast.literal_eval()` and must be a valid Python dict literal; any other result will raise a `ValueError` at parse time.

```
csv_column:     WALMAT
imas_path:      summary/wall/material/index
transform:      dictionary
transform_args: {"MO": 11, "W": 2, "Be": 10}
```

String cells are stripped of leading/trailing whitespace at load (the CSVs are padded), so dictionary keys are authored against the stripped values (`"MO"`, never `" MO"`). If a CSV value is not present as a key, the row is skipped for that pulse rather than raising an error. All uncovered values are reported upfront, with counts, by the pre-run validation (see [Upfront validation](#upfront-validation)); the runtime skip itself is silent.

#### Dictionary of lists

When a dict value is itself a Python list, the script performs a **many-to-one expansion**: it iterates the list and writes each element to a separate array-of-structures slot, using wildcard index replacement on the `imas_path` (see [Wildcard indexing](#wildcard-indexing-)).

```
csv_column:     AUXHEAT
imas_path:      core_sources/source(:)/identifier/index
transform:      dictionary
transform_args: {"NB": 2, "IC": 5, "EC": 3,
                 "NBIC": [2, 5], "NBEC": [2, 3],
                 "ECIC": [3, 5], "NBICEC": [2, 5, 3]}
```

`AUXHEAT = "NBIC"` resolves to `[2, 5]` and writes:

- `core_sources/source(0)/identifier/index = 2`
- `core_sources/source(1)/identifier/index = 5`

Single-value entries (e.g. `"NB": 2`) are treated equivalently to a one-element list and always land at index `0`.

### `formula`

Evaluates an arbitrary Python expression over the source row.  Every CSV column is bound as a **bare variable** named after the csv_column, so the expression can combine several columns:

```
csv_column:     TIME_X
transform:      formula
transform_args: TIME_X - TIME_Y
```

This writes `data_row["TIME_X"] - data_row["TIME_Y"]` to the target path. Python builtins such as `abs`, `min`, `max`, and `round` are available (e.g. `abs(TIME_X - TIME_Y)`).

`csv_column` is still required and acts as the **primary** column: if its value is missing (NaN) for a given pulse, the data cell is skipped for that pulse (same as every other transform).  Set it to one of the columns the formula uses.

Notes and limitations:

- Only columns whose names are **valid Python identifiers** can be referenced (no spaces, no leading digits).
- The primary `csv_column` is validated at startup; other columns named in the expression are resolved at run time.  A typo raises a `ValueError` at startup naming the offending row and formula; an expression that parses but fails at run time (bad date, division by zero) warns and skips that row, leaving the leaf empty.

---

## Path notation and indexing

`imas_path` uses `/` for hierarchy and parenthetical suffixes `()` for array indexing:

### Fixed indexing `(n)`

```
nbi/unit(0)/energy/data
```

Always targets element `n` of the AoS.  The array is resized if needed.

### Wildcard indexing `(:)`

```
core_sources/source(:)/identifier/index
```

The `:` is a placeholder resolved at write time.  For `imas_path` wildcards the index comes from the position in the list produced by the dictionary-of-lists expansion (`enumerate(value)`), so the first element lands at `(0)`, the second at `(1)`, and so on.  Two crosswalk rows that both carry `(:)` in their paths are independent (each starts from `0`).

Wildcards are resolved segment-by-segment by `replace_wildcard_index()`: it replaces only the `(:)` suffix of the matched segment (e.g.`source(:)` → `source(0)`), leaving the rest of the path untouched.

### Multiple target paths `&`

A single crosswalk row can fan out to several IDS paths by separating them with `&`.  The same (transformed) value is written to every path.

```
imas_path: summary/time(0)&equilibrium/time(0)&divertors/time(0)
```

Each path may belong to a different top-level IDS; the script creates IDS objects on demand.

---

## Sibling-pair writes

Many IDS nodes are not a bare scalar but a structure pairing a measured value with a companion string (provenance, label, etc.) as sibling leaves under a shared parent.  `summary/global_quantities/ip` is one: its children are `value`, `value_error_upper`, `value_error_lower` and `source`.  A row targeting such a node writes **two** leaves instead of one:

1. The **value leaf** receives the transformed CSV value.
2. The **companion leaf** receives the string from the `source` column.

At startup `resolve_value_leaves` looks up each `imas_path` and picks the pair:

- the node has a `value` sub-field (`summary/global_quantities/ip`) -> write `value` and `source`;
- the node is already a plain leaf (`summary/machine`, a `STR_0D`) -> write the node itself, appending nothing;
- `source_fields` is set → use the two leaves it names, whatever the DD shape (see below).

```
# source_fields blank, imas_path = "summary/global_quantities/ip"
summary/global_quantities/ip/value  <- transformed CSV value
summary/global_quantities/ip/source <- row["source"], e.g. "experiment"

# source_fields blank, imas_path = "summary/machine"
summary/machine                     <- transformed CSV value (no leaf appended)
```

### Customising the leaf names with `source_fields`

Set `source_fields` to a 2-tuple of strings to name the leaves explicitly, overriding the DD-derived pair.  The **first** element is the value leaf; the **second** is the companion leaf.  The cell is parsed with `ast.literal_eval()` and must be a 2-tuple of strings; anything else raises a `ValueError` at startup naming the offending `csv_column`.

Use it for the nodes that pair a value with a companion but do not follow the `value`/`source` shape.  `summary/wall/material` is an identifier structure (`name`, `index`, `description`, with no `value`), so its rows name the pair explicitly:

```
# source_fields = ("index", "description")
# csv_column = WALMAT, imas_path = "summary/wall/material"
summary/wall/material/index       <- transformed CSV value
summary/wall/material/description <- row["source"]
```

This applies to every transform type (`identity`, `dictionary` including dictionary-of-lists, and `formula`).  For dictionary-of-lists, the companion string is written alongside each expanded AoS slot.

The companion (source) string is written into **every pulse** alongside the value leaf, when the value is present.  If `source` is blank, only the companion leaf is omitted: the value leaf is still the one the DD selected.

### Numeric `source`: a constant companion value

When `source` is a **number** rather than a string, it is treated as a real value rather than a provenance label.  It is written to the companion leaf in **every pulse** alongside the value leaf.  This is the eval-free way to attach a fixed constant to a sibling node.

```
# source_fields = ("rho_tor", "rho_tor_norm"), source = 0.95
# csv_column = R95, imas_path = "summary/local/pedestal/position"
summary/local/pedestal/position/rho_tor      ← transformed CSV value (R95, per pulse)
summary/local/pedestal/position/rho_tor_norm ← 0.95 (constant, in every pulse)
```

A numeric companion is **ungated**: it is written into every pulse even when the primary `csv_column` value is missing for that pulse (the value leaf is simply left empty).  This makes it a way to stamp a fixed constant into each IDS.  (String companions, by contrast, are only written when the row has a real value.)

So the companion gating is asymmetric by type:

- **string** `source` → written into the pulse when the value is present;
- **numeric** `source` → written into every pulse, unconditionally;
- **dict** `source` → resolved per pulse by machine name, written to the pulse IDS when the value is present (see below).

**Constraint:** when `source_fields` is set, both named leaves must exist as sub-fields of the `imas_path` node.  The check is automatic (see [Upfront validation](#upfront-validation)); the DD-derived pair always satisfies it.

### Machine-specific source

When provenance differs across machines, set `source` to a Python dict literal mapping machine name to the provenance string.  The cell is parsed with `ast.literal_eval()` and must be a valid dict literal.

An optional `"default"` key applies to any machine that has no more specific entry of its own.  A machine-specific entry always overrides `"default"` entirely (it is not joined or concatenated). Use it for the machines whose provenance genuinely differs from the rest.

```
# source = {"default": "EFIT", "JET": "JFIT"}
# imas_path = "summary/global_quantities/ip"
summary/global_quantities/ip/value  ← transformed CSV value (per pulse)
summary/global_quantities/ip/source ← "JFIT" for JET pulses, "EFIT" for every other machine
```

A dict source is resolved per pulse against the pulse's machine name and written into the pulse IDS: the machine's own key wins if present, otherwise `"default"` is used, otherwise the companion leaf is skipped for that pulse.  A `summary/machine` mapping row is required; the script raises at load if none exists and a dict source is in use.

---

## The sidecar

Some per-variable information is a property of the **data**, not of the mapping, and is sparse: only a handful of variables carry it, and it is structured (a list, or a value per machine) rather than a single scalar. A crosswalk column would cost a cell on every row and force that structure to be stringified. It lives instead in a YAML **sidecar** named `<mapping stem>.yaml`, e.g. `resources/mappings/2008_crosswalk.yaml` for `resources/mappings/2008_crosswalk.xlsx`. It is auto-discovered from the existing `-m/--mapping` path; no CLI flag is involved.

The file has five optional top-level sections. Four are keyed by `csv_column`; `database` is the exception, a single whole-database description rather than one entry per variable. `sentinels` additionally accepts one reserved key, `global`, that is not a `csv_column` (see [`global`](#global-dataset-wide-placeholders)):

```yaml
resolve:                        # conflict rules for constants that vary across time-slices
  LUPDATE:
    strategy: max
  EVAP:
    strategy: avoid
    avoid: ["NONE"]

sentinels:                      # no-data placeholder values
  global: [-9.999e-09, "."]
  AUXTIME: [-9.999e-09]
  ECHMODE: ["????????", "."]

errors:                         # per-machine error bars
  IP:
    JET: 0.05
    TFTR: {abs: 300000}
    D3D: [0.10, 0.20]

standard_names:                 # IMAS standard name for a manifest variable
  IGRADB: ion_grad_b_drift_direction

database:                       # whole-database description -- see `database` below
  name: "ITPA Global H-Mode Confinement Database"
  version: "DB5.2.3"
  paper: "G. Verdoolaege et al., \"...\", Nucl. Fusion 61 076006 (2021), https://doi.org/..."
  maintainers: ["Geert Verdoolaege, Ghent University"]
```

An entry naming a variable absent from the crosswalk warns at startup (`sentinels: global` is exempt, being reserved rather than a variable name). A **missing sidecar file** also warns and applies nothing. An unrecognised section name raises.

### `sentinels`

A list of no-data placeholders for one variable. A source value **exactly equal** to an entry is treated as missing, so the leaf falls back to the IMAS empty (`EMPTY_FLOAT`/`EMPTY_INT`, or `""` for string leaves) instead of being written as a real datum.

Matching is by exact value **and type**. Where a CSV column holds a mix of ints and strings (pandas reads it as `object` dtype) list both forms, e.g. `NESOL: [0, "0"]`; a bare `[0]` will not match the string `"0"` and the sentinel silently does nothing. Strings are stripped before comparison, matching how the data CSV is loaded.

Sentinel values are also excluded from the dictionary-coverage check, so a placeholder is not reported as an uncovered `dictionary` key.

#### `global`: dataset-wide placeholders

Scalar databases typically share a handful of fill codes across most of their columns, so listing them under every variable would be repetitive and easy to leave incomplete. The reserved key `global` holds placeholders that apply to **every** `csv_column` in the crosswalk:

```yaml
sentinels:
  global: [-9.999e-09, 1.7e+38, -9999999, "????????", ".", "********"]
  TEV: [1, 10]
  TE0: [1, 10, 9.999e-09]
```

A variable that has its own entry still inherits the global ones. A global marker that occurs both as a number and as a string needs both forms listed (`[0, "0"]`), and a numeric marker only ever matches numeric cells.

PyYAML follows YAML 1.1, where a float in exponent form needs **both** a decimal point and a signed exponent. The same value written three ways: `1.0e+38` is a float, while `1e+38` (no decimal point) and `1.0e38` (unsigned exponent) are **strings**, and a string sentinel never matches a numeric cell. Plain decimals such as `0.00000001` are always safe.

### `resolve`

See [Resolving constant conflicts across slices](#resolving-constant-conflicts-across-slices).

### `errors`

Many IDS leaves carry an uncertainty in a sibling field: for a value at `IMAS_PATH`, the upper error bar lives at `IMAS_PATH + "_error_upper"`. Because the confinement database spans multiple devices with different measurement uncertainties, error bars are authored **per machine**.

Each machine maps to an error **spec** in one of three forms:

| Spec     | YAML              | Bar written |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Relative | `0.03` (= 3 %)    | `abs(value) * 0.03` |
| Range    | `[0.10, 0.20]`    | `abs(value) * max(range)` (conservative upper bound; the min is discarded) |
| Absolute | `{abs: 300000}`   | the value verbatim, in IDS units (independent of `value`) |

```yaml
errors:
  IP:                           # -> summary/global_quantities/ip
    JET: 0.05
    AUG: 0.03
    TFTR: {abs: 300000}
    D3D: [0.10, 0.20]
```

For each pulse the script looks up that pulse's machine (the value mapped to `summary/machine`) and, if it is a key, writes the resolved bar to the `_error_upper` sibling of wherever the row's value landed:

- bare node → `<node>_error_upper`;
- sibling-pair write → `value_error_upper` (matching the DD layout).

Behaviour:

- **No entry for the variable** → nothing extra written (normal behaviour).
- **Machine not in the mapping** → no error written for that pulse, silently.

Relative and range bars are *relative*, so the absolute bar tracks the actual datum, including the post-transform result for `dictionary`/`formula` rows. An **absolute** spec is written verbatim and must already be in IDS units (the author pre-converts, e.g. cm→m, kW→W); `csv_unit`/`imas_unit` are documentation-only columns in the crosswalk, not an automatic conversion the script applies. The lookup requires a row mapping to `summary/machine`; the script raises at load if `errors` is used without one.

Errors that cannot be expressed in these three forms are left as free-text `notes` rather than encoded: compound (`±15% abs + ±2% rel`), value-conditional (phase-dependent), formula-dependent (`±0.05/bp`), or unquantified.

### `standard_names`

The IMAS standard name for a `status=manifest` variable, used as its `identifier/name` in the `temporary` IDS instead of the raw `csv_column` (see [Temporary IDSs](#temporary-idss)), and to route it into `metadata.standard_name.*` rather than `metadata.db_variable.*` under `--simdb` (see [SimDB ingestion](#simdb-ingestion---simdb)).

```yaml
standard_names:
  SPLASMA: area_of_separatrix
```

A variable absent from this section falls back to `csv_column` for its identifier name, and lands in `db_variable.*` under `--simdb`. Only `status=manifest` rows read this section; an entry against a mapped row is harmless but never applied.

### `database`

A free-text description of the source database as a whole -- not a per-variable entry like the other sections. Every field is optional:

```yaml
database:
  name: "ITPA Global H-Mode Confinement Database"
  version: "DB5.2.3"
  definitions: "https://osf.io/drwcq/"                    # link to the variable-definitions document

| Field                  | Type            | Meaning |

| `name`                  | str             | Name of the source database |
| `version`               | str             | Version/release identifier |
| `definitions`           | str             | Link to the original variable-definitions document |
| `paper`                 | str             | Citation for the associated paper (include a DOI/URL where available) |
| `csv`                   | list of str     | Where the source data can be obtained (a stable external URL) |
| `authors`               | list of str     | Authors/compilers credited for the database |
| `maintainers`           | list of str     | Current maintainers |
| `previous_maintainers`  | list of str     | Prior maintainers, if the database has changed hands |

`format_database_comment()` renders every present field into a single ` -- `-joined string, written verbatim to `ids_properties.comment` on **every** top-level IDS created for **every** pulse (see `new_ids`). An absent or empty `database` section (or one where every field is blank/empty) renders to `None` and no comment is written -- this is expected while fields are still placeholders pending manual completion.

## Temporary IDSs

Rows with `status = manifest` are **not** written to a named IDS in the physics hierarchy.  Instead they are stored in IMAS's `temporary` IDS, which provides generic typed buckets for values of arbitrary dimensionality (0-D scalars through 5-D arrays).

The `csv_dtype` column names the bucket and its indexing mode:

| `csv_dtype`                     | Meaning |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| `constant_float0d(:)`           | Float scalar slot at a stable index (assigned in crosswalk order) |
| `constant_string0d(:)`          | String scalar slot at a stable index (assigned in crosswalk order) |
| `constant_string1d(:)`          | String 1-D array slot; in per-pulse mode, each element corresponds to one time-slice (no `dynamic_string1d` array exists in the DD) |
| `dynamic_float1d(:)`            | Float time-series slot; stores per-slice values in `value/data` with a shared `value/time` axis |
| `dynamic_integer1d(:)`          | Integer time-series slot; same layout as `dynamic_float1d` |
| `constant_float0d(2)`           | Fix to slot 2; array is resized to at least 3 with `keep=True`, leaving intermediate slots empty if not yet filled |
| `constant_float0d` *(no index)* | Always write to slot 0; warns if two rows clash on the same bare bucket |

The `constant_*` buckets store a single scalar per pulse.  The `dynamic_*` buckets accumulate one value per time-slice and are only meaningful in the default per-pulse mode (they reduce to a one-element array in `--per-time-slice` mode).  When the script is run with `--simdb`, all populated bucket types (constant and dynamic) are extracted into the manifest's `variables.*` metadata.

The `(:)` suffix assigns a **stable index**, keyed by the segment name before `(:)` (e.g. `constant_float0d`).  Indices are assigned once, in crosswalk (row) order (**not** per pulse), so a given variable occupies the **same** slot in every pulse.  A pulse that lacks data for a variable simply leaves that slot empty.  This gives a deterministic, consistent layout across all pulses.

As with physics-IDS rows, both the value and the descriptor strings (identifier name/description) are written directly into the pulse:

```
constant_float0d(n)/value                  <- transformed CSV value
constant_float0d(n)/identifier/name        <- standard_names sidecar entry (if set), else csv_column
constant_float0d(n)/identifier/description <- csv_description (if present)

dynamic_float1d(n)/value/data              <- transformed CSV value (one element per time-slice)
dynamic_float1d(n)/value/time              <- pulse's time vector (set after all slices are processed)
dynamic_float1d(n)/identifier/name         <- standard_names sidecar entry (if set), else csv_column
```

The `imas_path` column is ignored for manifest rows; the entire path is derived from `csv_dtype`.  Manifest rows are otherwise processed identically to physics-IDS rows (same transforms, same value/descriptor split).

### Copy into the manifest under `--simdb`

By default the `temporary` IDS is written to the HDF5 backend like any other root.  When the script is run with `--simdb` (see [SimDB ingestion](#simdb-ingestion---simdb)), the `temporary` IDS is still written to disk, and its values are also read back out (`identifier/name` → `value`) and attached to the pulse's SimDB manifest as `standard_name.*`/`db_variable.*` metadata (see [SimDB ingestion](#simdb-ingestion---simdb) for how that split is decided).  `csv_dtype` still drives the in-memory layout in both cases.

## Status values

| Status          | Behaviour |
| --------------- | --------- |
| `mapped`        | Primary, authoritative mapping to the IDS hierarchy. |
| `mapped_caveat` | Written to the IDS but subject to known caveats (sign conventions, approximations). See `notes`. |
| `manifest`      | Stored in the `temporary` IDS instead of a physics IDS (also copied into the SimDB manifest under `--simdb`).  Useful for quantities that have no stable IMAS path yet. |
| `derived`       | Not currently implemented; row is skipped.  Reserved for quantities that must be computed from other fields. |
| `discard`       | Deliberately not migrated; row is skipped.  See `notes` for why. |

Rows without a recognised `transform` value (`identity`, `dictionary`, `formula`) are also silently excluded from processing.

---

## Many-to-one transformations in the crosswalk

The crosswalk is **one-row-per-source-column**, not one-row-per-target-path.  A single source column can write to multiple targets in two complementary ways:

1. **`&`-separated paths** in `imas_path`: same value, multiple destinations.
2. **Dictionary of lists**: one source value expands into multiple elements of an AoS via wildcard indexing.

Both mechanisms are resolved within `resolve_writes()` and require no special columns beyond those already described.

---

## Upfront validation

Before any pulse is written, `validate()` checks the crosswalk against the data CSV and the Data
Dictionary (at `--dd-version`). Fatal problems **raise** (the migration would crash or write garbage
anyway); recoverable ones **warn** and continue:

| Check | Behaviour |
| ----- | --------- |
| Every `csv_column` exists in the data CSV | raise |
| Every `imas_path` (after `&` split and index stripping) exists in the DD; for sibling-pair rows both leaves of the pair exist under the node | raise |
| Formula `transform_args` parse, and every free name is a CSV column or Python builtin | raise |
| Dictionary / formula rows have a `transform_args` string | raise |
| Dictionary keys cover every value observed in the data column | warn, listing each uncovered value with its count (those rows are skipped silently at run time) |
| Machine keys in `errors` and dict-valued `source` cells name machines observed in the data (`"default"` exempt) | warn (a key that never matches writes nothing) |
| `manifest` rows have a `csv_dtype` | warn, row skipped |
| `manifest` rows' `csv_dtype` bucket names a real field on the `temporary` IDS | raise |
| Every sidecar entry names a `csv_column` present in the crosswalk | warn (an orphaned entry is never applied) |
| The sidecar file exists | warn, no sentinels/errors/resolve rules applied |

---

## Running the script

The script is a command-line tool.

```bash
# defaults: per-pulse grouping (one IDS set per machine/pulse combination)
python idstools/scripts/bin/idsmigration

# override inputs / behaviour
python idstools/scripts/bin/idsmigration -e 2008 -d 2008_data.csv -m 2008_crosswalk.xlsx \
    --dd-version 4.1.1

# one-IDS-per-row (old behaviour, restored with --per-time-slice)
python idstools/scripts/bin/idsmigration --per-time-slice
```

Run `python idstools/scripts/bin/idsmigration -h` for the full help. The arguments and their defaults are:

| Argument             | Default               | Purpose |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| `-e`, `--experiment` | `2008`                | Sub-folder under `resources/results/` for output |
| `-d`, `--dataset`    | `2008_data.csv`       | Input CSV filename under `resources/input/` |
| `-m`, `--mapping`    | `2008_crosswalk.xlsx` | Crosswalk spreadsheet filename under `resources/mappings/` |
| `--dd-version`       | `4.1.1`               | Data Dictionary version used to build the IDS factory |
| `--validate`         | off                   | Run crosswalk/data/DD validation and exit; nothing is written |
| `--simdb`            | off                   | Ingest each migrated pulse into the local SimDB (see below) |
| `--per-time-slice`   | off                   | Write one IDS set per CSV row instead of one per `(machine, pulse)` group |
| `-v`, `--verbose`    | off                   | Print each constant conflict as it is resolved (see [Seeing the conflicts](#seeing-the-conflicts--v)) |

### Default mode: per-pulse grouping

By default the script groups CSV rows by `(machine, pulse)`, sorts each group in ascending time order, and writes **one IDS set per pulse**.  Dynamic IDS nodes (those whose `kind` is `dynamic`) accumulate one value per time-slice; static and constant nodes are written once and checked for consistency across slices. Disagreements are resolved per [Resolving constant conflicts across slices](#resolving-constant-conflicts-across-slices) below (defaulting to keeping the first-seen value) and tallied into a summary printed at the end of the run.

The crosswalk must contain rows mapping to `summary/machine` and `summary/pulse` for grouping to work.  A `summary/time` mapping is optional but recommended; without it, slices are kept in CSV order and the `summary/time` vector is absent.  A row missing either the machine or the pulse value is dropped from the grouping entirely (it cannot be assigned to a pulse); the script warns with the count of such rows before processing begins.

Output is one directory per `(machine, pulse)` pair, named `{machine}_{pulse}`:

```
resources/results/tc26/
  aug_12345/
  aug_12346/
  jet_99001/
  ...
```

### Resolving constant conflicts across slices

A "constant"/`static` quantity that disagrees across a pulse's time-slices (e.g. a source data glitch, or two slices that should never differ physically) is, by default, resolved by keeping the first-seen value, and reported in a summary tally at the end of the run. For datasets where a handful of variables (typically 2-5) need a specific resolution instead, add a `resolve:` section to the dataset's [sidecar](#the-sidecar).

It maps a `csv_column` name to a resolution strategy:

```yaml
resolve:
  LUPDATE:
    strategy: max         # keep the lexicographically/chronologically greatest value
  EVAP:
    strategy: avoid
    avoid: ["NONE"]       # keep whichever candidate is not in this list
```

Available strategies:

| Strategy     | Behaviour |
| ------------ | --------- |
| `keep_first` | Keep the first value seen (the default for any variable not listed in the sidecar) |
| `keep_last`  | Keep the most recently seen value |
| `max`        | Keep the greater of the two conflicting values (works for numbers and for fixed-width, zero-padded date strings such as ISO 8601, which sort lexicographically in chronological order) |
| `min`        | Keep the lesser of the two conflicting values |
| `avoid`      | Keep whichever value is not in the required `avoid` list; if both or neither are, keeps the first-seen value |

Strategies are applied incrementally as each slice is written, so `max`/`min`/`avoid` converge to the correct result across any number of conflicting slices regardless of arrival order. An unknown `strategy` name, or an `avoid` strategy missing its `avoid` list, raises an error when the sidecar is loaded at startup.

### Seeing the conflicts (`-v`)

The closing summary reports only *how many* pulses each variable was resolved in. To author the `resolve:` rules you need the values themselves: run with `-v`/`--verbose` and each conflict is printed as it is resolved, one line per (pulse, variable):

```
  conflict  ASDEX/32130  IGRADB: -1 vs 1 -- default (keep_first) keeps -1
  conflict  CMOD/931027036  EVAP: 'NONE' vs 'Li' -- avoid keeps 'Li'
  conflict  CMOD/941129022  LUPDATE: '1995-01-10T00:00:00Z' vs '1995-01-21T00:00:00Z' -- max keeps '1995-01-21T00:00:00Z'
```

Lines reading `default (keep_first)` are the variables with no `resolve:` entry (they show what the fallback is silently choosing, which is usually what motivates adding a rule). The line count always matches the closing tally: both are keyed on (pulse, variable), so a pulse whose slices disagree repeatedly is reported once, on its first disagreement.

### `--per-time-slice` mode (one IDS per row)

Restores the original behaviour: each CSV row becomes an independent IDS set, written to a sequentially-numbered directory:

```
resources/results/2008/
  pulse_0000/
  pulse_0001/
  ...
```

Each directory is a valid IMAS DBEntry accessible via:

```python
uri = "imas:hdf5?path=resources/results/2008/pulse_0000;pulse=0"
with imas.DBEntry(uri, "r") as entry:
    summary = entry.get("summary")
```

## SimDB ingestion (`--simdb`)

`simdb` is an **optional** dependency.  When it is importable and `--simdb` is passed, the migration ingests **one SimDB entry per pulse** as it runs.  If `--simdb` is given but the package is not importable, the script prints a warning and continues the migration with ingestion disabled.

Each entry's manifest carries:

| Field                                   | Source |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `alias`                                 | **default mode:** `{dataset}/{machine}/{pulse}`; **`--per-time-slice` mode:** `{dataset}-{machine}-{index}`, where `dataset` is the `--experiment` value and `index` is a per-machine counter |
| `metadata.dataset` / `metadata.machine` | the experiment label and the pulse's `summary/machine` value |
| `metadata.standard_name.*`              | manifest quantities copied from the `temporary` IDS (see [Copy into the manifest under `--simdb`](#copy-into-the-manifest-under---simdb)) whose crosswalk row has a sidecar [`standard_names`](#standard_names) entry, keyed by that standard name |
| `metadata.db_variable.*`                | the same, for manifest quantities with no `standard_names` entry, keyed by `csv_column` instead |
| `outputs.uri`                           | `imas:hdf5?path=<pulse_dir>#summary` (a **reference** to the on-disk summary IDS) |
| `inputs[].uri`                          | Absolute `file:` URIs for the crosswalk XLSX, its same-stem YAML sidecar (when present), and the original input CSV, in that order; shared by every pulse entry in the run |

Input URIs use the filesystem of the Python environment running the migration. Linux records paths such as `file:///home/user/IDStools/resources/mappings/TC26_crosswalk.xlsx`; Windows records `file:///C:/Users/...`. On Windows only, the migration adjusts SimDB's file-URI parser in its own process to handle drive letters and URI escaping during ingestion and database reads. Linux behavior and the installed SimDB package are unchanged.

Each manifest quantity lands in exactly one of the two groups, decided per-row by `temp_var_name()`: a sidecar `standard_names` entry sends it to `standard_name.<name>`; a blank one falls back to `db_variable.<csv_column>`.  This keeps quantities with an agreed IMAS standard name distinguishable, when queried later, from ad-hoc database columns that don't have one yet (e.g. `simdb simulation query standard_name.loss_power=...` vs `db_variable.SELEC2007=...`).

SimDB is a metadata catalogue: it stores the manifest plus a checksummed *reference* to the `summary` IDS, not its array data.  The `summary` IDS is therefore always written to HDF5, with or without `--simdb`; the `temporary` IDS is written too. This matters because recent SimDB versions store a numeric metadata array only as its `{min, max}` range (`simdb/json.py`, `CustomEncoder`), so the per-time-slice values of `db_variable.*`/`standard_name.*` survive only in the HDF5 files.  A `summary/machine` mapping row is required; the script raises at load if `--simdb` is used without one.
